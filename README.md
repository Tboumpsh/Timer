# Timer 



This is a **cue timer** for athletes. Those who exercise at home and do not like to use the phone timer.

## About the project:

I think this is my third or fourth serious js project.
This is a timer in dark mode.
With the ability to start and end and reset.
This project is set with 'setInterval'.
Just an hour after I learned this topic.



## about me :

Hello, my name is Fatima.
A few months ago, I seriously entered the front field.
And js it's been a few weeks since I started seriously.
I would be happy if you visit my other repositories and learn more about me and my work



## Working with the project:

Click on the green button to start the timer.
be careful!!!!
Your time has begun.
Now you can time and step by pressing the red button.
Did you make a mistake in timing? So press the yellow button and start from the beginning.
